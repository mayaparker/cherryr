The goal of cherryr is to simulates the game Hi-Ho Cherry-O.

## Installation

You can install the development version of cherryr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` {r}
# install.packages("cherryr")
pak::pak("mayaparker/cherryr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example of how to play the game:

```{r example}
library(cherryr)

game1 <- play_game(tree = 10, max_game = 100)
game1

```

A plot of a game of Hi-Ho Cherry-O over time:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(game1)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
